# Libft - Your Own C Library

## Introduction

Libft is a custom C library that contains implementations of commonly used functions in C. This library serves as a useful toolkit for future projects at school. The functions included in this library are inspired by standard C library functions, with some additional useful functions to build your projects.

## Mandatory Part

### Part 1 - Libc Functions

These are the re-implemented standard C library functions that follow the prototypes of the originals but with the prefix `ft_`. They do not require any external libraries.

- **`ft_isalpha`**: Checks if the character is an alphabetic letter.
- **`ft_isdigit`**: Checks if the character is a digit.
- **`ft_isalnum`**: Checks if the character is either a digit or an alphabetic letter.
- **`ft_isascii`**: Checks if the character is in the ASCII table.
- **`ft_isprint`**: Checks if the character is printable.
- **`ft_strlen`**: Calculates the length of a string.
- **`ft_memset`**: Fills a block of memory with a specified byte.
- **`ft_bzero`**: Sets all bytes in a memory block to zero.
- **`ft_memcpy`**: Copies a memory block to another.
- **`ft_memmove`**: Copies memory regions that might overlap.
- **`ft_strlcpy`**: Copies a string to a destination buffer, ensuring null-termination.
- **`ft_strlcat`**: Concatenates two strings, ensuring null-termination.
- **`ft_toupper`**: Converts lowercase letters to uppercase.
- **`ft_tolower`**: Converts uppercase letters to lowercase.
- **`ft_strchr`**: Locates the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- **`ft_strrchr`**: Locates the last occurrence of a character in a string.
- **`ft_strncmp`**: Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.
- **`ft_memchr`**: Searches for a byte in a memory block.
- **`ft_memcmp`**: Compares two blocks of memory.
- **`ft_strnstr`**: Locates the first occurrence of a substring in a string, with a size limit.
- **`ft_atoi`**: Converts a string to an integer.
- **`ft_calloc`**: Allocates memory and initializes it to zero.
- **`ft_strdup`**: Duplicates a string using dynamic memory allocation.

### Part 2 - Additional Functions

These functions are not part of the standard library but are useful for string and memory manipulation.

- **`ft_substr`**: Extracts a substring from a string, starting at a given index with a specified length.
- **`ft_strjoin`**: Concatenates two strings into a new string.
- **`ft_strtrim`**: Removes specified characters from the beginning and the end of a string.
- **`ft_split`**: Splits a string into an array of substrings, separated by a given delimiter.
- **`ft_itoa`**: Converts an integer to its string representation.
- **`ft_strmapi`**: Applies a function to each character of a string, passing its index as the first argument.
- **`ft_striteri`**: Iterates over each character of a string and applies a function to each character.
- **`ft_putchar_fd`**: Outputs a character to the specified file descriptor.
- **`ft_putstr_fd`**: Outputs a string to the specified file descriptor.
- **`ft_putendl_fd`**: Outputs a string followed by a newline to the specified file descriptor.
- **`ft_putnbr_fd`**: Outputs an integer to the specified file descriptor.

## Bonus Part - Linked List Functions

These additional functions handle linked list operations. A linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

The list node structure:

```c
typedef struct s_list
{
    void            *content;
    struct s_list   *next;
} t_list;
```
### Libft Bonus Functions

This README covers the bonus functions implemented for the Libft project. These functions extend the basic functionality of the library to include operations on linked lists.

## Introduction

The bonus part of the Libft project introduces functions for manipulating linked lists. These functions enable you to create, modify, and manage lists efficiently.
Functions
ft_lstnew

c

## t_list *ft_lstnew(void *content);

## Description: Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a new node. The content member is initialized with the value of the parameter content. The next member is initialized to NULL.

Parameters:

    content: The data to be stored in the node.

Returns: A pointer to the new node or NULL if the allocation fails.
ft_lstadd_front

c

## void ft_lstadd_front(t_list **lst, t_list *new);

## Description: Adds the node new at the beginning of the list.

Parameters:

    lst: The address of a pointer to the first link of a list.
    new: The node to be added to the list.

Returns: None.
ft_lstsize

c

## int ft_lstsize(t_list *lst);

## Description: Counts the number of nodes in a list.

Parameters:

    lst: The beginning of the list.

Returns: The number of nodes in the list.
ft_lstlast

c

## t_list *ft_lstlast(t_list *lst);

## Description: Returns the last node of the list.

Parameters:

    lst: The beginning of the list.

Returns: The last node of the list.
ft_lstadd_back

c

## void ft_lstadd_back(t_list **lst, t_list *new);

## Description: Adds the node new at the end of the list.

Parameters:

    lst: The address of a pointer to the first link of the list.
    new: The node to be added to the list.

Returns: None.
ft_lstdelone

c

## void ft_lstdelone(t_list *lst, void (*del)(void *));

## Description: Takes as a parameter a node and frees the memory of the nodeâ€™s content using the function del and frees the node itself. The memory of next must not be freed.

Parameters:

    lst: The node to free.
    del: The address of the function used to delete the content.

Returns: None.
ft_lstclear

c

## void ft_lstclear(t_list **lst, void (*del)(void *));

## Description: Deletes and frees the given node and every successor of that node, using the function del and free(3). The pointer to the list must be set to NULL.

Parameters:

    lst: The address of a pointer to a node.
    del: The address of the function used to delete the content of the node.

Returns: None.
ft_lstiter

c

## void ft_lstiter(t_list *lst, void (*f)(void *));

## Description: Iterates the list lst and applies the function f on the content of each node.

Parameters:

    lst: The address of a pointer to a node.
    f: The address of the function used to iterate on the list.

Returns: None.
ft_lstmap

c

## t_list *ft_lstmap(t_list *lst, void *(*f)(void *), void (*del)(void *));

## Description: Iterates the list lst and applies the function f on the content of each node. Creates a new list resulting from the successive applications of the function f. The del function is used to delete the content of a node if needed.

Parameters:

    lst: The address of a pointer to a node.
    f: The address of the function used to iterate on the list.
    del: The address of the function used to delete the content of a node if needed.

Returns: The new list or NULL if the allocation fails.
